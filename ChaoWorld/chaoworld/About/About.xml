  <description>Chao have made it to the distant Rim... or did they originate here? Regardless, you will need to decide how you deal with their presence. Will you hunt them for their delicious meat? Or will you forge bonds of friendship that will survive the darkness of the looming future.

Whatever destiny you forge, the Chao will be a part of this journey!
